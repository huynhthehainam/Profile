# Welcome to Hai Nam profile!
5 years of experience in working with .NET and Microsoft technologies. I'm also good at using ReactJs to build SPA but not good at CSS and HTML. I also work or research on microservice design and build some projects follow that. I'm able to dockerize and deploy web project. I'm currently learning Kubernetes. 

# Projects

I just create 2 samples project for my family material shop:
[Hardware shop API](https://github.com/huynhthehainam/hardware-shop)
[Hardware shop FrontEnd](https://github.com/huynhthehainam/hardware-shop-frontend)

Beside of that, I also have some projects below but it belongs to my old company. So I removed sensitive data:
